ou need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the surface and perimeter for multiple types of shape: rectangle, square, circle and triangle.

The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate the total sum for perimeter and for surface.

Also, the application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added to the drawing tool. In case 2 similar shapes are added, an appropriate exception must be thrown.

To deliver the work, just make a zip file and attach it to the answer.
